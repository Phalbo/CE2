# CapricEngine v2.20


## Changelog (v2.20) 


*   **Mood-Based Generation:** The song generation logic has been significantly improved to be more mood-aware.
    *   **Song Structure Templates:** Added 20 new song structure templates, each with a descriptive name (e.g., "Build & Collapse", "Fast Spiral") and associated with a specific mood. The UI now displays these names and filters them based on the selected mood.
    *   **Mood Profiles:** Introduced a new `MOOD_PROFILES` data structure that links moods to specific scales and style notes. This ensures a more coherent and context-aware musical output.
    *   **Smarter Key Selection:** When "Random" is selected for the key, the engine now chooses from a list of scales appropriate for the selected mood.

*   **UI/UX Improvements:**
    *   The "Structure Template" dropdown is now dynamically populated based on the selected mood.
    *   "Style Notes" are now displayed in the UI, providing a hint about the musical direction of the generated piece.

*   **Code Refactoring:**
    *   Replaced the old `MOOD_SONG_STRUCTURES` with the more comprehensive `MOOD_PROFILES`.
    *   Refactored the song generation and UI rendering logic to use the new mood-based system.

## Overview

CapricEngine is a web-based application that procedurally generates musical compositions. It allows users to select a mood, tempo, and key, and then generates a complete song structure with chords, a bassline, a melody, and a drum track. The application is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and uses the `midiwriter.js` library to export the generated music as MIDI files.

## Architecture

The application is divided into several modules, each responsible for a specific part of the song generation process.

### Core Modules

*   **`main/app-song-generation.js`**: This is the main module that orchestrates the song generation process. It defines the song structure, generates the chord progression, and creates the `mainChordSlots` that are used by the other generators.
*   **`main/app-midi-export.js`**: This module handles the creation and download of MIDI files for each track. It contains functions to generate the MIDI events for the chords, bassline, melody, and drums.
*   **`main/app-ui-render.js`**: This module is responsible for rendering the generated song data in the user interface. It displays the song structure, chords, and other information.
*   **`main/app-setup.js`**: This module initializes the application, sets up the user interface, and attaches event listeners to the various controls.

### Generator Modules


*   **`gen/generateBassLineForSong.js`**: This module generates the bassline for the song. It uses a sophisticated algorithm to create a bassline that is both rhythmically and harmonically interesting.
*   **`gen/bass-pitch-selector.js`**: This module contains the logic for selecting the pitches for the bassline. It uses a weighted random selection process to choose notes that are harmonically appropriate and create a smooth bassline.
*   **`gen/melody-generator.js`**: This module generates the melody for the song.
*   **`gen/generateVocalLineForSong.js`**: This module generates a vocal line for the song.
*   **`gen/generateDrumTrackForSong.js`**: This module generates the drum track for the song.

### Library Modules

*   **`lib/theory-helpers.js`**: This module contains a collection of helper functions for performing music theory calculations, such as getting the notes of a chord or a scale.
*   **`lib/config-music-data.js`**: This module contains the configuration data for the application, such as the available moods, tempos, and keys.
*   **`lib/midiwriter.js`**: This is an external library that is used to create the MIDI files.

## Future Development

Here is a list of potential improvements and new features for future versions of CapricEngine:

### 1. Humanization and Dynamics

*   **Centralized Velocity Humanization:** Introduce a `humanizeVelocity(base = 80, range = 10)` function to be used across all generators (melody, bass, drums, vocals). This function should not only add randomness but also incorporate musical logic, such as accenting strong beats, creating crescendos/decrescendos, and generating ghost notes.
*   **Micro-timing Adjustments:** Introduce subtle variations in the `startTick` of notes (e.g., +/- 5 ticks) to create a more human-like groove and swing feel.

### 2. Expanded Rhythmic and Harmonic Variety

*   **Advanced Arpeggios:** Create an `ARPEGGIO_PATTERNS` library with a variety of arpeggio patterns (e.g., root-fifth-third-octave, minor-7th, pentatonic, dominant-tension). The generator will then probabilistically select from this library to create more interesting and varied arpeggios for the bass and rhythm chords.
*   **Expanded Bass Rhythmic Patterns:** Continue to expand the `BASS_RHYTHMIC_PATTERNS` library with more genre-specific patterns (e.g., funk, reggae, disco, alt-rock) to increase the rhythmic variety of the basslines.

### 3. Generative Basslines

*   **Generative Bass Mode:** Add a "GENERATIVE" mode to the bassline generator that creates note durations based on weighted probabilities (e.g., 70% = 1 beat, 20% = 0.5 beats, 10% = 2 beats or legato). This will create more unpredictable and organic basslines.
*   **Intelligent Walking Basslines:** Implement a `generateWalkingLineToNextRoot()` function that connects the current root note to the next one with a series of diatonic or chromatic passing notes. This will be particularly useful for creating smooth transitions in bridges and verses.

### 4. Expanded Song Structures

*   **More Structure Templates:** Increase the number of available song structure templates from 10 to 20.
*   **Named and Categorized Structures:** Each structure template should have a descriptive name (e.g., "Emotive Ballad," "Riff & Release," "Funk Jam") and be categorized by mood or genre in the UI to make it easier for users to find the structure they're looking for.

### 5. Improved Melody and Vocal Lines

*   **Vocal Articulation and Dynamics:** Add more realistic variations in velocity to the vocal lines, with accents on the beginning and end of phrases.
*   **More Varied Vocal Rhythms:** Reduce the number of forced repetitions and introduce more natural-sounding pauses to make the vocal lines less monotonous.
*   **Contour-Based Melodies:** Implement support for generating melodies based on predefined contours (e.g., rising, falling, arch).

### 6. Humanized Drumming

*   **Hi-Hat Dynamics:** Introduce variations in hi-hat velocity to create a more realistic pop groove.
*   **Snare and Kick Variations:** Add subtle variations in the timing and velocity of snare and kick hits.
*   **Ghost Notes and Backbeat Accents:** Incorporate ghost notes and accents on the backbeat to create more dynamic and interesting drum patterns.

### 7. User Experience and Exporting

*   **In-Browser MIDI Preview:** Allow users to preview the generated tracks in the browser using the Web Audio API and a SoundFont or a library like `tone.js`.
*   **MusicXML Export:** Consider adding the ability to export the generated music as MusicXML files, which can be imported into a wide range of notation software.
*   **Custom Presets:** Allow users to save their own custom patterns and presets for future use.
